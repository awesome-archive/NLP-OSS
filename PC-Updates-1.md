Dear Program Committee Members, 

Thank you all again for accepting our invitation to the NLP-OSS 2020 Program Committee! 

Some updates on the NLP-OSS organization as we proceed to submit our proposal for the ACL 2020 [Call for Worksop Proposal](https://acl2020.org/calls/workshops/).

 - Firstly, we welcome Nelson Liu (Stanford University) and Geeticka Chauhan (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) as our new co-organizers for the workshop. They share the same passion for opens source, experimental replicability and sustainability in the NLP. 
 
 - We thank all PC members who had been on the committee in 2018 and continued to support the workshop in 2020. If you affiliations have changed recently and it's not reflected correctly on https://github.com/nlposs/NLP-OSS/blob/master/Proposal-2020.md, please do reply to this email and we'll make the changes accordingly for the NLP-OSS 2020 website. If we haven't hear from you to step down from the PC role, we had automatically add you in as part of the PC in NLP-OSS 2020. *However, we do encourage you to acknowledge the invitation so that we can plan the review assignments appropriately.*
 
 - We welcome new PC members from our fellow PC members' and co-organizers contact as well as new invitations extended to the Widening NLP community through the [BIG directory](http://www.winlp.org) as well as our shortlisted members whom have expressed interest through our [proposal survey](https://forms.gle/Ln9icghRaaLcsnPAA).
 
 - We are excited to have all 3 invited speakers, Chip Huyen (from NVIDIA, working on varous NLP projects ranging from the SOTAWHAT, LazyNLP, OpenSeq2Seq, Nemo), Spencer Kelly (creator of the [Compromise Javascript NLP library](https://github.com/spencermountain/compromise)) and Thomas Wolf (from Huggingface working on the various open source libraries including the popular PyTorch Transformers).
 
 - We have drafted a code of conduct on top of [ACL's anti-harassment policy](https://github.com/nlposs/NLP-OSS/blob/master/Code-of-Conduct.md). We are waiting for the ACL Professional Conduct Committee to get back to us on whether the code of conduct is valid for the NLP-OSS workshop and community. 

Here's some logistically updates: 

 - Our proposal is located at https://github.com/nlposs/NLP-OSS/blob/master/Proposal-2020.md If you noticed that your affiliations or link to URL is not correct, please do tell us or raise and issue or pull request to the repo and we'll make the appropriate edits.

 - If you would like to make suggestions/edits to the proposal, please feel free to make the edits on the repo too, even tbough it may be after the submission deadline, we'll incorporate the suggestions so that the edits make it to the the NLP-2020 webpage. 

 - Currently, the https://nlposs.github.io page still links to the old 2018 workshop, we'll refactor the page on https://github.com/nlposs/nlposs.github.io in a couple of weeks. Please also feel free to open pull-request on the webpage if you would like to do so. 
 
 - We'll most probably open a slack page for all PCs (after the proposal results) and invited speakers so that you can leave messages and have a direct line to reach us (organizers) on issues/topics related to the workshop.
 
We will give you another update on more details after the results of the proposal after 20 Oct 2019. 

Keep in touch!

Best Regards,
NLP-OSS Organizers
