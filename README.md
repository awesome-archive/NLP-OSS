# Workshop for NLP Open Source Software (NLP-OSS)

This is the Github page where we keep track of the developments of NLP-OSS workshop. 

The [ACL/COLING/EMNLP/NAACL proposal](https://acl2020.org/calls/workshops/) is at https://github.com/nlposs/NLP-OSS/blob/master/Proposal.md

Let's use the issue tracker to do the following:

 - confirm the people in the program committee
 - track progress of the workshop website
 - catch suggestions/comments and grammar errors in the proposal (please create new issues, when appropriate)
   - the proposal is unpolished and everything is open to changes =)
